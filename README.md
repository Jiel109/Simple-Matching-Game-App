This is a simple matching game where you tap on a flipped picture to see what's beneath. The game will not end until you find all matching pairs.
This game/app was done as a submission to a task performance under Fundamentals of Mobile Programming.

-Issues-
The app/game bugs sometimes when you tap too fast, and I didn't put a reset button because I will miss the submission deadline if I tried to add it. 
Plus, it's only optional to the instructions of the task given to me.
